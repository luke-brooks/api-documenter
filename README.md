# api-documenter
A small app that gathers data about an API and creates a useful documentation.

The ApiDocumenter is designed to be added to an existing .NET API. Once implemented, the ApiDocumenter will gather information about all of the ApiControllers on a given API. This information includes: Controller names, method names, method parameter names and types, method return types, and a JSON string of any complex objects that are method return types or method parameter types.

A front-end processing and Razor C# view will be added to the repository in the future.
